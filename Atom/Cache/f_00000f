If you dislike this\nfunctionality, you can disable it from the Bracket Matcher section of the\nSettings View.\n\n#### Custom Pairs\n\nYou can customize matching pairs in Bracket Matcher at any time. You can do so either globally via the Settings View or at the scope level via your `config.cson`. Changes take effect immediately.\n\n* **Autocomplete Characters** - Comma-separated pairs that the editor will treat as brackets / quotes. Entries in this field override the package defaults.\n  * For example: `\u003c\u003e, (), []`\n\n* **Pairs With Extra Newline** - Comma-separated pairs that enhance the editor's auto indent feature. When used, a newline is automatically added between the pair when enter is pressed between them. Note: This feature is meant to be used in combination with brackets defined for indentation by the active language package (`increaseIndentPattern` / `decreaseIndentPattern`).\nExample:\n```\nfn main() {\n    | \u003c---- Cursor positioned at one indent level higher\n}\n```\n\n#### Scoped settings\nIn addition to the global settings, you are also able to add scope-specific modifications to Atom in your `config.cson`. This is especially useful for editor rule changes specific to each language. Scope-specific settings override package defaults _and_ global settings.\nExample:\n```cson\n\".rust.source\":\n  \"bracket-matcher\":\n    autocompleteCharacters: [\n      \"()\"\n      \"[]\"\n      \"{}\"\n      \"\u003c\u003e\"\n      \"\\\"\\\"\"\n      \"``\"\n    ]\n```\n","metadata":{"name":"bracket-matcher","version":"0.87.3","main":"./lib/main","description":"Highlight the matching bracket for the `(){}[]` character under the cursor.
